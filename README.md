# TrainTime
       
This train scheduler started out as a bootcamp assignment to learn firebase and moment.js.

It was lacking some features that would allow it to have real-world value.

I have added functionality to edit and delete trains, reset the form and some much needed form validation.

Feel free to test it out!!
