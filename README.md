# TrainTime

![train schedule for Reading Railroad](https://github.com/DMWIGGINS/TrainTime/blob/master/assets/images/trainschedulethumbnail.png)



This train scheduler started out as a bootcamp assignment to learn Firebase and Moment.js.

It was lacking some features that would allow it to have real-world value.

I have added functionality to edit and delete trains, reset the form and some much needed form validation.

_Made with Firebase, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Moment.js_
